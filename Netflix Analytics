#In this SQL code, I'm querying a database that's holding Nexflix data to answer questions about the data using PostgreSQL:

#1. How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows)

SELECT COUNT (*) FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie';

#2. When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database? 

SELECT MAX(date(date_added)) FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

#3. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order. 

SELECT title FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title asc;

#4. Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star?

SELECT np.director
 FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" np
 LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" nt
 ON np.show_id=nt.show_id
 WHERE nt.title = 'Bright Star';

#5. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made? 

SELECT release_year
 FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
 WHERE type = 'Movie'
 ORDER BY release_year asc
 LIMIT 1;
