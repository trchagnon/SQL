--SQL Murder Mystery

-- Help the detective solve the crime. The clues are that there was a murder that occurred sometime on Jan.15, 2018 and that it took place in SQL City
-- I used the following query to retrieve the information from the crime_scene_report database

SELECT * 
FROM crime_scene_report
WHERE type = 'murder' AND date = 20180115 AND city = 'SQL City';

-- Security footage shows that there were 2 witnesses. The first witness lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr". The second witness, named Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave".
-- How I found the first witness in the person database and joined the transcript from the interview database

SELECT person.name, interview.transcript
FROM person
JOIN interview
ON person.id = interview.person_id
WHERE address_street_name = 'Northwestern Dr'
ORDER BY address_number desc
LIMIT 1;

-- Morty Schapiro	I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".

-- Next I joined the following 3 tables to find the suspect: person, drivers_license, and get_fit_now_member

SELECT p.name, dl.gender, dl.plate_number, gf.id, gf.membership_status
FROM person p
JOIN drivers_license dl
ON p.license_id = dl.id
JOIN get_fit_now_member gf
ON gf.person_id = p.id
WHERE gf.id LIKE '48Z%' AND membership_status  = 'gold'AND plate_number LIKE '%H42W%' AND gender = 'male'

-- Looks like the murder suspect is Jeremy Bowers. I want to double check with what the second witness has to say

-- How I found the second witness in the person database and joined the transcript from the interview database

SELECT person.name, interview.transcript
FROM person
JOIN interview
ON person.id = interview.person_id
WHERE name LIKE '%Annabel%' AND address_street_name = 'Franklin Ave'

-- Annabel Miller	I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out last week on January the 9th.

-- Next I joined the get_fit_now_member database with the get_fit_now_check_in to confirm murder suspect Jeremy Bowers did indeed check in on January the 9th.

SELECT * FROM get_fit_now_member
JOIN get_fit_now_check_in
ON get_fit_now_member.id  = get_fit_now_check_in.membership_id
WHERE name = 'Jeremy Bowers' AND check_in_date = 20180109

-- Congrats, you found the murderer! But wait, there's more... If you think you're up for a challenge, try querying the interview transcript of the murderer to find the real villain behind this crime. If you feel especially confident in your SQL skills, try to complete this final step with no more than 2 queries.

-- I used the following query to display information from the interview database

SELECT * 
FROM interview
WHERE person_id  = 67318

--I was hired by a woman with a lot of money. I don't know her name but I know she's around 5'5" (65") or 5'7" (67"). She has red hair and she drives a Tesla Model S. I know that she attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017.

--Next I joined the following 3 tables to display the information I needed to find the real brains behind the murder: person database, drivers_licsense database, and facebook_event_checkin database.

SELECT p.id, p.name, dl.height, dl.hair_color, dl.gender, dl.car_model, fb.event_name, fb.date
FROM person p
JOIN drivers_license dl
ON p.license_id = dl.id
JOIN facebook_event_checkin fb
ON fb.person_id = p.id
WHERE height BETWEEN 65 AND 67 AND hair_color = 'red' AND gender = 'female' AND car_model = 'Model S' AND date LIKE '201712%'
