#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length (orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 

SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderID) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT DISTINCT cust.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
ON cust.order_id=feb.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT DISTINCT product, price FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
ORDER BY price asc
LIMIT 1;
#OR
SELECT DISTINCT Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price IN (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales); 

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT SUM(Quantity)* price as revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT SUM(Quantity), Product, SUM(Quantity)* price as revenue 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
GROUP BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT cust.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
on Feb.orderid = cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT SUM(Quantity), Product, location
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like "%Los Angeles%"
GROUP BY Product;

#10. How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?

SELECT SUM(Quantity), Product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales

GROUP BY Product;

#11. What was the average amount spent per account in February? 

SELECT SUM(Quantity*price)/COUNT(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderID = cust.order_id;

#12. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?

SELECT SUM(Quantity)/COUNT(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderID = cust.order_id;

#13. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?

SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY SUM(Quantity*price) desc
